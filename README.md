# mbed-lvgl

This is a port of the open-source embedded graphics library, LittlevGL, to the open-source RTOS from ARM, Mbed-OS.

Under the hood, it uses another project of mine that was originally a part of this effort, uDisplay. I decided to split of uDisplay to make the code more reusable. The motivation was so other developers could use the diplay drivers built on Mbed even if they didn't want to use the full-blown mbed-lvgl graphics solution.

This way, mbed-lvgl is another optional layer of additional functionality if the hardware can support it and if the application requires it.
